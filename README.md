# Nature of Code - Python

Recreating the programming projects by Daniel Shiffman, in Python

[Daniel Shiffman](http://github.com/shiffman/The-Nature-of-Code) wrote a book and created YouTube videos accompanying the material, called [Nature of Code](http://www.natureofcode.com) where he gets to model/build natural systems in code.

The code is in Processing (Java); Processing is an open source programming language and environment for people who want to create images, animations, and interactions.
